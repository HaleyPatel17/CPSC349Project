            Through the use of C++, I was able to help develop a food wastage tracker. 
            This tracker accounts for the meal, how much of it was wasted, the method of disposal, 
            when you ate the food, and the amount of money that you have lost due to the wastage. 
            The user can generate a report that gives advice to the user on how to waste less food. 
        </p><br>
    
        <p>
            Many aspects of the tracker, such as the frontend and database, have already been developed. 
            My task involved creating and developing the classes and objects for this project. 
            These classes involved adding a food wastage record, getting records, generating a report, and much more. 
            Then, I would connect it to the backend to allow user inputs to be stored.
        </p><br>
    
        <p>
            One of the main challenges that I faced during this task was figuring out how to allow records to be 
            saved onto a file in the server. Without this crucial step, the data that the user imputed will be lost. 
            To overcome this, I contacted my peers for guidance.
