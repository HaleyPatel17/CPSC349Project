            HabitFlow is a website dedicated to help users keep track of their habits. 
            When users create an account in HabitFlow, they can input tasks into the database in order to get a reminder. 
            These reminders are sent to the usersâ€™ email that they used to login to HabitFlow. 
            Each habit can be customized, meaning users can choose the days and time that they wish to be reminded of specific habits. 
            There is a number next to each habit called a streak, which represents how many times in a row the user was able to complete the habit.

            I was part of a team with three other people to help build and create HabitFlow. 
            The backend of HabitFlow was developed by two members of the team through the use of Python and SQL Alchemy. 
            I worked with another member to develop the frontend of HabitFlow. This was done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
            My tasks were to design the navigation bar, the homepage, and menu popups.

        <p>
            When starting this project, the team and I had no idea where to begin. 
            We had little to no knowledge about front and back-end engineering. 
            Although I was able to pick up the basics of HTML and CSS, there was a learning curve of how to implement javascript properly. 
            It was critical that users are able to interact with certain elements displayed on the interface, such as opening the menu. 
            In order to solve this issue, I communicated with my teammates and we found resources to deepen our understanding.
