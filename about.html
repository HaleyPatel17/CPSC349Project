        <p class="intro">Hello, I'm Haley! I am currently 20 years old.
             I was born and raised in southern California. I love doodling in 
             my free time. I also love painting. I have been painting for about 8 
             years now. 
             <br>
             <br>
             I took courses at Fullerton College before transfering. I currently go to university and
             attend California State University, Fullerton as a junior.
             I am majoring in computer science and I plan 
             on graduating in spring of 2026.
             <br>
             <br>
             Throughout my college journey, I have developed my programming skills in languages such as C++ and python. 
             I am currently learning more about web development to have a better understanding about it.
